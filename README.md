# PSO_dobot_arm_control
PSO-Based Inverse Kinematics for WiFi-Controlled Dobot Robotic Arm This project implements Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to control a Dobot robotic arm using WiFi (ESP32). The system calculates the optimal joint angles to move the robotic arm to a desired target position and sends these angles wirelessly to the ESP32 for execution.
